# Hades

Hades is an early access game by SuperGiant Games. The game features power-ups known as "boons", and some of the special boons required other boons as "prerequisites". This web application is meant to provide the user an easy way to view all the special boons that branch out of each prerequisite boon.

## Work-in-Progress

This is a very messy project right now, as I'm literally creating my own JSON file for the boons and gods featured in the game, and querying the data in using GraphQL.
